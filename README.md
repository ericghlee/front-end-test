# FRONTEND SKILS ASSESSMENT PROJECT

For this task you will be creating a **React login single page application**. This application will take various input parameters and store data about transactions.

**It must be production quality according to your understanding of it: testing, readme.md etc. ff there's no instruction how to run the code or/and it doesn't compile, it will NOT QUALIFY**

The application should have the following features:
## Features

##### The application should have a login in two steps:
- first step for *email* field and a 'next' button
	- there should be an email validation
	- the email validation can be done while the user writes it or after trying the 'next' button
	- if the email is valid and the user tries the 'next' button, it should go to the next step
- second step for *password* field
	- for test purposes, if the user put any text that contains 'test' the user must be logged
	- if the password doesn't match it should return a message
	- if the password matches it should redirect to the home page.
	
##### Home page:
- It should contain only a welcome message

#### Observations:
The stylization doesn't need to be too elaborated, it's allowed to use pre made themes but your CSS should be organized.

## FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
Please write this application in React. You are free to implement this however you’d like with whatever resources or 3rd party code you’d want.

**Deadline**: We expect you to get back to us with the solution in 7 days. It won't be better if you delivery before, so if you finish early, improve your code. Finally, don't rush, if you need more time please ask us whenever you need.

Create a private project in GitHub and share with us your code.

The repo should have your name, for example **"_eric-lee-sample-java-test_"**, it will help us to identify your test.

Feel free to ask questions at any time (eric.lee@payclip.com).
